You need to keep the truncate_log.sh file in the desirable directory 

You need to give permission also as the file needs read and write access to work properly

You need to write the command chmod +x truncate_log.sh

The above command provides the required permission to the file

Then run ./truncate_log.sh {output_filename} to get the result
